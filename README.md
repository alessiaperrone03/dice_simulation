# Dice Simulation

## Overview

The **Dice Simulation** is a Python-based program that simulates rolling a dice with customizable sides and roll count. The user can specify the number of sides the dice should have (default is 6) and how many times they want to roll the dice. The program will display the results of each roll and give the player the option to roll again.

## Features
- Simulates rolling a dice with any number of sides (default is 6).
- Allows the user to specify how many times to roll the dice.
- Displays the results of each dice roll.
- Offers the option to roll again after each round.

1. The program will ask you to specify the number of sides for the dice (default is 6).
2. Then, it will prompt you to enter how many times you want to roll the dice.
3. The program will display the results of the dice rolls.
